## Overview

CliniForge Triage provides a configurable environment for simulating patient allocation and redistribution within a simplified hospital workflow. The application emphasizes software architecture, state management, algorithmic decision-making, and interactive user experience through a healthcare-inspired use case.

The project is designed to demonstrate practical programming concepts while maintaining a professional and intuitive interface for experimentation and visualization.

## Core Functionality

### Patient Intake

* Register new patients through an interactive dashboard
* Automatic assignment of unique patient identifiers
* Configurable dosage-based triage thresholds
* Real-time room assignment upon admission

### Dynamic Redistribution

* Automatic reassessment following dosage updates
* Configurable high-priority bed capacity
* Threshold-driven promotion and demotion logic
* Persistent state management across application pages

### High-Priority Waitlist

* Automatic overflow handling when capacity is exceeded
* Hybrid prioritization model:

  * Primary ranking by dosage
  * Secondary ranking by arrival order
* Automatic promotion when capacity becomes available

### Dashboard Interface

* Multi-page navigation
* Real-time room visualization
* Interactive patient management
* Configurable operational parameters

                  Yes             No
                  |               |
                  v               v
        High Priority        Normal Room
             |
             | Capacity Full
             v
      High Priority Waitlist
             |
             | Bed Available
             v
        High Priority Room
```

Patient redistribution is performed dynamically as operating parameters or patient attributes change, ensuring that assignments remain consistent with current system constraints.

## Design Philosophy

CliniForge has been developed through iterative refinement, with new functionality added as workflow requirements evolved. The project prioritizes maintainability, modular design, and transparent system behavior over unnecessary complexity.

Its objective is not to replicate a production electronic health record system, but to explore how software engineering principles—including state management, algorithm design, and user-centered interface development—can be applied to healthcare-inspired operational problems.
